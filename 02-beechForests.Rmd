# NZ Beech Forests {#nzbs}

The first beech forest paper assumes and tests the following process:


$$ outcome = \beta_0 + \beta_1(sex_i) + \beta(age_i) + error_i $$

```{r echo=FALSE}
grViz("
digraph boxes_and_circles {

  # a 'graph' statement
  graph [overlap = true, fontsize = 10]

  # several 'node' statements
  node [shape = box,
        fontname = Helvetica]
  b0; b1; b2; error

  node [shape = circle,
        fixedsize = true,
        width = 0.9] // sets as circles
  sex; age; 
  
  # several 'edge' statements
  b1->sex; b2->age
}
")
```
