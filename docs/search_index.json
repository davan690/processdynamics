To understand the true underlying trends in the data a pilot study with a large enough sample is explored below. Here we have a difficult question to address due to the bias in the data capture method. This is really interesting and challenging from a statistical prospective. This is also a problem that the qualitative approach fails to address (waiting to see what others say about this..?) Here is a step-by-step to approach to this research in a quantativite way: The questions are grouped into sets of questions that all address a general objective or question the research has. We can first see if these patterns are true for the responses. These are as follows: grViz(&quot; digraph boxes_and_circles { # a &#39;graph&#39; statement graph [overlap = true, fontsize = 10] # several &#39;node&#39; statements node [shape = box, fontname = Helvetica] Q1; error node [shape = circle, fixedsize = true, width = 0.9] // sets as circles 1; 2; 3; 4; # several &#39;edge&#39; statements Q1-&gt;1 Q1-&gt;2 Q1-&gt;3 Q1-&gt;4 1-&gt;general 2-&gt;general 3-&gt;A 4-&gt;D 4-&gt;G 4-&gt;F E-&gt;3 4-&gt;V 1-&gt;C 2-&gt;H 3-&gt;M E -&gt;error } &quot;) There are several issues with this because the data collected is often non-normal and needs to be transformed. The first step however is to simply visualise the data in a way that we will also be fitting the statistical models. var &lt;- c(&quot;scale&quot;,&quot;name&quot;,&quot;Q1.1&quot;,&quot;Q1.2&quot;,&quot;Q1.3&quot;,&quot;Q1.4&quot;,&quot;Q2.1&quot;,&quot;Q2.2&quot;,&quot;Q2.3&quot;,&quot;Q2.4&quot;,&quot;Q2.5&quot;,&quot;Q2.6&quot;,&quot;Q2.7&quot;,&quot;Q2.8&quot;,&quot;Q2.9&quot;,&quot;Q2.10&quot;,&quot;Q3.1&quot;,&quot;Q3.2&quot;,&quot;Q3.3&quot;,&quot;Q4.1&quot;,&quot;Q4.2&quot;,&quot;Q5.1&quot;,&quot;Q5.2&quot;,&quot;Q5.3&quot;) # dat &lt;- read.csv(&quot;./data/overall_dummy_data.csv&quot;) # glimpse(dat) grViz(&quot; digraph boxes_and_circles { # a &#39;graph&#39; statement graph [overlap = true, fontsize = 10] # several &#39;node&#39; statements node [shape = box, fontname = Helvetica] Q1; Q2; Q3; Q4; Q5; error node [shape = circle, fixedsize = true, width = 0.9] // sets as circles 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8 # several &#39;edge&#39; statements Q1-&gt;1 Q1-&gt;2 Q1-&gt;3 Q1-&gt;4 Q2-&gt;5 Q2-&gt;6 Q2-&gt;7 Q2-&gt;8 Q2-&gt;9 Q2-&gt;10 Q1-&gt;11 Q2-&gt;12 Q2-&gt;13 Q2-&gt;14 Q3-&gt;15 Q3-&gt;16 Q3-&gt;17 Q4-&gt;18 Q4-&gt;19 Q5-&gt;20 Q5-&gt;21 Q5-&gt;22 1-&gt;general 2-&gt;general 1-&gt;A 2-&gt;D 1-&gt;G 1-&gt;F E-&gt;6 4-&gt;V 5-&gt;C 6-&gt;H 3-&gt;M } &quot;) There is some simple dataset transformations that can be done to make it easier to work with the data in the plotting functions. 6.3 Flow diagram Here I think we should add the relationship to each question and the proposed hypothesis… "],
["mixed.html", " 7 Mixed regression models 7.1 Models", " 7 Mixed regression models 7.1 Models Mixed models essentially start with sample mean differences between groups and then add additional complexity in favour of poor fitting models. You can write out models and variable relationships using statistical equations such as \\(y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1(x_i)\\) where the variables can be collected either through direct questions or transformed data from the orginal questions. What does it look like in a diagram explaining how the variables are proposed to be similar? Example below: 7.1.1 Constant only \\[ outcome = \\beta_0\\] 7.1.2 Single predictor \\[ outcome = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1(sex_i)\\] 7.1.3 Multi-level v1 For example you might think that generally individuals that … \\[ outcome = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1(sex_i) + \\beta(age_i) + error_i \\] 7.1.4 Multi-level v2 For example you might think that generally individuals that … \\[ outcome = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1(sex_i) + \\beta(age_i) + error_i \\] "]
